# The current volume of a water reservoir (in cubic metres)
reservoir_volume = 4.445e8
# The amount of rainfall from a storm (in cubic metres)
rainfall = 5e6

# decrease the rainfall variable by 10% to account for runoff

# add the rainfall variable to the reservoir_volume variable

# increase reservoir_volume by 5% to account for stormwater that flows
# into the reservoir in the days following the storm

# decrease reservoir_volume by 5% to account for evaporation

# subtract 2.5e5 cubic metres from reservoir_volume to account for water
# that's piped to arid regions.

# print the new value of the reservoir_volume variable

rainfall=rainfall*0.9
reservoir_volume+=rainfall
reservoir_volume+=reservoir_volume*0.05
reservoir_volume-=reservoir_volume*0.05
reservoir_volume-=2.5e5
